Gutenberg Project Book Analysis

I approached this project with a simple goal: to see how written language has change over the year. 

The analysis will be performed on books published from 1900-1950 that have entered the public domain.

Book will be of English language and will be of novel(maybe prose) style.

Eventually, I will want to analyze data from all English written literature.
